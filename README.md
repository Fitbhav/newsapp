✅ What this does, step by step:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/newsapp.git → Clones your project repo.

cd newsapp → Enters the project folder.

npm install → Installs all dependencies (React, Next.js, Tailwind, etc.).

npm run dev → Starts the Next.js development server on http://localhost:3000.

If you want, I can make an even bigger command that also:

Installs Node.js if not installed

Installs Tailwind CSS and sets it up

Creates the pages, components, and public folders

Adds the full boilerplate code

…so you can literally run one command and have the project ready to go.





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
